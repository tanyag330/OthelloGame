# OthelloGame
Got bored? Here's I have an amazing 2-player board game, Othello, for you made in Java. Spend your time playing othello in GUI or command mode as you like.
Othello is a classic strategy game, also known as Reversi. Its objective is to finish the game with the greater amount of pieces (circles) of the same color. My role was to the backend code only not GUI.
